# LedBlinker benchmarks

To run all benchmarks, simply run:
```sh
python3 run_bench.py
```

It will generate results under `report/` directory.

_Note: Internally, numerous files in the project are replaced for each benchmark, but the originals are kept under `backups/` and are restored after `run_bench.py` finishes._
